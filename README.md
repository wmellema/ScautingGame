# Ragnarok3

This is an assignment for Scauting using a modified version of the Ragnarok3 engine and the original Block Platformer game.

## Requirements

```
git
python3.6
text editor (Preferably Atom or Sublime)
terminal emulator
```
## Installation

Use the following commands to get the game running
```
git clone https://github.com/wmellema/ScautingGame.git
cd ScautingGame
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Code
python Start.py
```
## Assignment

The current version of this game has no horizontal hazards, and you cannot move left yet.
These 'bugs' will need to be fixed.

You can find the corresponding code blocks in Hero.py, on lines 38 and 78.
Once you're done with the assignment, you can create your own level in Maps/_Level0_/ using the other levels as reference.

# Good luck and have fun!
